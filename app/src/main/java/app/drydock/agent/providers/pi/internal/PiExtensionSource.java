/**
 * The drydock bridge extension, as TypeScript pi loads with {@code -e}.
 *
 * <p>Held as a text block rather than a jar resource so there is no extraction
 * step and no temp-file fallback to fail silently. <strong>Every backslash in
 * the TypeScript must be doubled here</strong>, exactly as
 * {@code ClaudeHookInstaller.HOOK_SCRIPT} does for its {@code sed}
 * expressions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing type-checks this string: pi loads it through {@code jiti}, which
 * strips types without checking them. The only guard is
 * {@code scripts/pi-bridge-smoke.sh}, which runs it against a mock server.</p>
